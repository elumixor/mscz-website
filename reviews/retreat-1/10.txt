When Didi had an interactive time when we were stepping into the circle, Iâ€™d like to talk not only about general fun stuff, but also about hard experiences that crave compassion. Such as who battled cancer with a close person, who lost a person to cancer, who had a health injury/issue that they overcome, who criticized oneself so much you lost any hope in oneself etc. such topics bring healing when people open to love of the community and bond ppl forever
